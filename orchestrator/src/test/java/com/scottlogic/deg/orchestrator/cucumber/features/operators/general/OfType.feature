Feature: User can specify that a field is of a specific type (string, integer, decimal, or datetime).

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = integer request that includes a number value (not a string) should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to 1
    And foo has type "integer"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 1   |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = integer request that includes a number value (as a string) should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to "1"
    And foo has type "integer"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 1   |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = decimal request that includes a decimal number value should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to 0.66
    And foo has type "decimal"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | 0.66 |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = decimal request that includes a negative number value should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to -99.4
    And foo has type "decimal"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo   |
      | -99.4 |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = integer request that includes a negative number value should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to -99
    And foo has type "integer"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | -99 |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = integer request that includes the number zero should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to 0
    And foo has type "integer"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 0   |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = decimal request that includes the number zero should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to 0
    And foo has type "decimal"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo |
      | 0   |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = datetime request that includes a date value (not a string) should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to 2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
    And foo has type "datetime"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                      |
      | 2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = datetime request that includes a date value (leap year) should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to 2020-02-29T09:15:00.000Z
    And foo has type "datetime"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                      |
      | 2020-02-29T09:15:00.000Z |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = datetime request that includes a date value (system max future dates) should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z
    And foo has type "datetime"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo                      |
      | 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = datetime request that includes an invalid date value should fail with an error message
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to 2010-13-40T00:00:00.000Z
    And foo has type "datetime"
    Then the profile is invalid because "Date string '2010-13-40T00:00:00.000Z' must be in ISO-8601 format: Either yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS\[Z\] between 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z and 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z or yyyy-mm-dd between 0001-01-01 and 9999-12-31"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = datetime request that includes an invalid time value should fail with an error message
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to 2010-01-01T75:00:00.000Z
    And foo has type "datetime"
    Then the profile is invalid because "Date string '2010-01-01T75:00:00.000Z' must be in ISO-8601 format: Either yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS\[Z\] between 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z and 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z or yyyy-mm-dd between 0001-01-01 and 9999-12-31"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = date request should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to 2010-01-01
    And foo has type "date"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo        |
      | 2010-01-01 |

  @ignore #pending development of 1381 - Add date time and fields
  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = time request should be successful
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo is equal to T09:15:00.000Z
    And foo has type "time"
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo            |
      | T09:15:00.000Z |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofType' = string request without other constraints should generate strings up to implicit maximum length
    Given there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo has type "string"
    And the generation strategy is random
    And the generator can generate at most 20 rows
    Then foo contains strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusively
