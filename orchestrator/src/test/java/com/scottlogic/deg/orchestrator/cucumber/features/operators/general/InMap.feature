Feature: User can specify that a field value belongs to a set of predetermined options.

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
### inMap alone ###
  Scenario: Running an 'inMap'
    Given the following non nullable fields exist:
      | HomeNation |
      | Capital    |
    And the file "testFile" contains the following data:
      | Country          | Capital   |
      | England          | London    |
      | Northern Ireland | Belfast   |
      | Scotland         | Edinburgh |
      | Wales            | Cardiff   |
    And HomeNation has type "string"
    And Capital has type "string"
    And HomeNation is from Country in testFile
    And Capital is from Capital in testFile
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | HomeNation         | Capital     |
      | "England"          | "London"    |
      | "Northern Ireland" | "Belfast"   |
      | "Scotland"         | "Edinburgh" |
      | "Wales"            | "Cardiff"   |

  Scenario: Running an 'inMap' with text a restriction
    Given the following non nullable fields exist:
      | HomeNation |
      | Capital    |
    And the file "testFile" contains the following data:
      | Country          | Capital   |
      | England          | London    |
      | Northern Ireland | Belfast   |
      | Scotland         | Edinburgh |
      | Wales            | Cardiff   |
    And HomeNation has type "string"
    And Capital has type "string"
    And HomeNation is from Country in testFile
    And Capital is from Capital in testFile
    When Capital is matching regex /^[BE].*/
    When HomeNation is matching regex /^[S].*/
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | HomeNation | Capital     |
      | "Scotland" | "Edinburgh" |

  Scenario: Running an 'inMap' multiple maps
    Given the following non nullable fields exist:
      | HomeNation |
      | Capital    |
      | Foo        |
      | Bar        |
    And the combination strategy is exhaustive
    And HomeNation is anything but null
    And Capital is anything but null
    And the file "testFile" contains the following data:
      | Country          | Capital   |
      | England          | London    |
      | Northern Ireland | Belfast   |
      | Scotland         | Edinburgh |
      | Wales            | Cardiff   |
    And the file "testFile2" contains the following data:
      | Foo | Bar |
      | 1   | one |
      | 2   | two |
    And HomeNation has type "string"
    And Capital has type "string"
    And Foo has type "decimal"
    And Bar has type "string"
    And HomeNation is from Country in testFile
    And Capital is from Capital in testFile
    And Foo is from Foo in testFile2
    And Bar is from Bar in testFile2
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | Country            | Capital     | Foo | Bar   |
      | "England"          | "London"    | 1   | "one" |
      | "England"          | "London"    | 2   | "two" |
      | "Northern Ireland" | "Belfast"   | 1   | "one" |
      | "Northern Ireland" | "Belfast"   | 2   | "two" |
      | "Scotland"         | "Edinburgh" | 1   | "one" |
      | "Scotland"         | "Edinburgh" | 2   | "two" |
      | "Wales"            | "Cardiff"   | 1   | "one" |
      | "Wales"            | "Cardiff"   | 2   | "two" |
