Feature: User can specify the length of generated string data using 'ofLength'

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a nullable field foo
    And foo has type "string"

  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request on a roman alphabet character string should be successful
    Given foo is of length <length>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"  |
      | "aa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo        |
      | null       |
      | <expected> |
    Examples:
      | length | expected |
      | 1      | "a"      |
      | 2      | "aa"     |

  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a negation of a valid numeric length should be successful
    Given foo is anything but of length <length>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"  |
      | "aa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo        |
      | null       |
      | <expected> |
    Examples:
      | length | expected |
      | 1      | "aa"     |
      | 2      | "a"      |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofLength' request on a roman alphabet character string value and white space should be successful
    Given foo is of length 10
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"          |
      | "  10  10  " |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo          |
      | null         |
      | "  10  10  " |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofLength' for a length of zero should be successful
    Given foo is of length 0
    And foo is in set:
      | ""  |
      | "a" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | null |
      | ""   |

  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a invalid value should fail with an error
    Given foo is of length <length>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a" |
    Then the profile is invalid because "(Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be an Integer but was a String with value `.*`)|(Cannot create an StringHasLengthConstraint for field 'foo' with a a negative length.)|(String length must have a value >= 0, currently is -?\d+)"
    And no data is created
    Examples:
      | length |
      | -1     |

    Given foo is of length 1000
    And the generator can generate at most 1 rows
    And the generation strategy is random
