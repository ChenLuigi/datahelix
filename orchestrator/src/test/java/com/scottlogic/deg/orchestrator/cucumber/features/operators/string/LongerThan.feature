Feature: User can specify that a string length is longer than, a specified number of characters

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a nullable field foo
    And foo has type "string"

  Scenario: Running a 'longerThan' request that includes positive value should be successful
    Given foo is longer than 5
    And foo is in set:
      | "aaaa"   |
      | "aaaaa"  |
      | "aaaaaa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo      |
      | null     |
      | "aaaaaa" |

  Scenario: Running a 'longerThan' request that includes the value zero should be successful
    Given foo is longer than 0
    And foo is in set:
      | ""  |
      | "a" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | null |
      | "a"  |

  Scenario: 'longerThan' a negative number should fail with an error
    Given foo is longer than -5
    Then the profile is invalid because "String length must have a value >= 0, currently is -5"
    And no data is created

  Scenario: Multiple non-contradictory 'longerThan' requests should be successful
    Given foo is longer than 2
    And foo is longer than 1
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"   |
      | "aa"  |
      | "aaa" |
      | "aab" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo   |
      | null  |
      | "aaa" |
      | "aab" |

  Scenario: Valid 'longerThan' and not 'longerThan' requests should be successful
    Given foo is longer than 1
    And foo is anything but longer than 3
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"    |
      | "aa"   |
      | "aaa"  |
      | "aaaa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo   |
      | null  |
      | "aa"  |
      | "aaa" |

  Scenario: Multiple not 'longerThan' requests should be successful
    Given foo is anything but longer than 5
    And foo is anything but longer than 6
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"      |
      | "aa"     |
      | "aaa"    |
      | "aaaa"   |
      | "aaaaa"  |
      | "aaaaaa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:

      | null    |
      | "a"     |
      | "aa"    |
      | "aaa"   |
      | "aaaa"  |
      | "aaaaa" |

  Scenario: Running a 'longerThan' request against non contradicting 'shorterThan' should be successful
    Given foo is longer than 2
    And foo is shorter than 5
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"      |
      | "aa"     |
      | "aaa"    |

    And foo is in set:
      | "a"    |
      | "aa"   |
      | "aaa"  |
      | "aaaa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo    |
      | null   |
      | "aaa"  |
      | "aaaa" |

  Scenario: Not 'longerThan' with non contradicting 'shorterThan' should be successful
    Given foo is anything but longer than 5
    And foo is shorter than 3
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"     |
      | "aa"    |
      | "aaa"   |

    And the generation strategy is random
    And the generator can generate at most 1 rows

  Scenario: longerThan with value larger than maximum permitted should fail with an error message
    Given foo is longer than 1001
    And foo has type "string"
    Then the profile is invalid because "String length must have a value <= 1000, currently is 1001"
