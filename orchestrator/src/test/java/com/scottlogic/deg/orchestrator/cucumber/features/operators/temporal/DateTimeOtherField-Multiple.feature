Feature: running datetimes related to otherfield datetimes for multiple fields

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a non nullable field foobar
    And foobar has type "datetime"
    And there is a non nullable field foo
    And foo has type "datetime"
    And there is a non nullable field bar
    And bar has type "datetime"
    And the combination strategy is exhaustive

  Scenario: Running a "before" and "after" constraint
    Given the generator can generate at most 1 rows
    And foobar is before field bar
    And foobar is after field foo
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foobar                   | foo                      | bar                      |
      | 0001-01-01T00:00:00.001Z | 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | 0001-01-01T00:00:00.002Z |

  Scenario: Running a "before" and "equalTo" constraint
    Given the generator can generate at most 1 rows

      | foobar                   | foo                      | bar                      |
      | 0001-01-01T00:00:00.001Z | 0001-01-01T00:00:00.001Z | 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z |

  Scenario: Running two "after" constraints
    Given the generator can generate at most 1 rows

      | 0001-01-01T00:00:00.001Z | 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | 0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z |

  Scenario: Running two "before" constraints switched other field constraints
    Given the generator can generate at most 1 rows
